# silkie

This is a reasoner for defeasible logic, the Nute version and its team defeat/no team defeat, ambiguity propagation/blocking variants, with an option for loop detection.

Supported features of the propositional defeasible logic language:

-- strict rules
-- defeasible rules
-- defeaters
-- rule priorities
-- one term per consequent
-- conflict sets are pairs of a term and its negation

Supported features for the predicate version:

-- at most two arguments per predicate
-- all variables in the consequent must appear in antecedent (no existential rules)
